`gradlew bootJar` builds a jar under build/libs/jar

`gradlew bootRun` runs the project directly. Alternatively use an IDE with spring support builtin

### Structure
`src` contains the java source, all work is under the `circuitcollective` package


### REST
Interactive API docs are available at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html once the project is running.
